          <p id="pizza">Place the warm water in a large mixing bowl. Pour the yeast mixture should begin to bubble.<br>
             Put the flour, olive oil, and salt in the mixing bowl with the mixture.<br>
             Use the dough hook attachmenton your stand mixture to stir the ingredients together until it becomes smooth and elastic.<br>
             Form it into a ball and place it in a warm part of the kitchen.<br>
             Let the dough sit and rise until it has doubled in size, which should take about 2 hours.<br>
             Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Farenheit (218 degrees celcius).<br>
             Do this before you're rwady to bake the pizza,so the oven has plenty of time to get quite hot.<br>
             If your oven tends to run cool, turn the temperature up to 450 degrees Farenheit (232 degrees celcius)<br>
             If you're using a baking sheet, place it in the oven at this time<br>
             Form the crusts. Divide the dough into two equal parts and shape them each into balls.<br>
             On a floured work surface, roll out the first ball of dough into a circular shape, or use your fingers to stretch it out and shape it.<br>
             If you're feeling ambitious, you could also try tossing the dough to form it into a pizza shape.<br>
             When you're finished with the first crust, make the second.<br>
             Get the crusts ready to bake.<br>
             Use a pastry brush to spread a thin coating of olive oil over the tops of the crusts.<br>
             Spread homemade pizza sauce (or sauce from a jar) onto the crusts.<br>
             Layer on your favorite toppings, making sure not to go overboard or the crusts won't get crisp.<br>
             Finish by sprinkling on your favorite type of cheese.<br>
             Bake the pizzas one at a time.<br>
             Carefully remove the baking sheet or stone from the oven and sprinkle it with some cornmeal (or reach into the oven to sprinkle it on).<br>
             Transfer the pizza to the baking stone or sheet, and place it back in the oven.<br>
             Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.<br>
             Repeat with the second pizza.<br>

                 <h3> <li> <strong>Jollof Rice</strong> </li> </h3>
             </ul>
             <img src="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Nigerian-Style-Jollof-Rice#/Image:IMG_0259.jpg" alt="image of nigerian jollof rice">
             <p id="jollof-rice">Blend your tomatoes, scotch bonnet and tatashe together. Chop your onions and keep them aside.<br>
               Put your rice into a bowl and soak with hot water. Allow this to soak for 10-15 minutes.<br>
               Then, wash with warm water and keep aside, or parboil your rice and wash.<br>
               This is important as you will get rid of excess starch in the rice.<br>
               Put your oil in a pot and allow it to heat up.<br>
               Add your chopped onions and allow to fry, but be sure not to burn them.<br>
               Add your blended ingredients and pur√©e and allow to fry, just until you get rid of the sour taste (about 10-15 minutes).<br>
               Add your maggi, garlic, ginger, curry, thyme and salt and mix together.<br>
               Be careful with your maggi as you do not want it too salty (2 maggi cubes for a cup of rice).<br>
               Add your stock or water, and mix too.<br>
               Taste to adjust to any seasoning.<br>
               Pour your rice into the pot and mix together, making sure it is covered in the tomato sauce.<br>
               Cook on low medium heat. Check your rice after at least 10 minutes, using a wooden spatula to dip into the rice.<br>
               This helps with getting the sauce to get the bottom of the pot, so that it does not start burning when the rice is not cooked.<br>
               Cook until soft. Do not overcook your rice or get your rice too soggy.<br>
               When rice is soft, lower the heat and allow to simmer so the water will get completely dry.<br>
               Serve with fried plantain and your choice of meat, if desired.
